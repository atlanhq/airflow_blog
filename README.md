## Installation and Usage
You can install the dependencies using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
<pre>

Make sure you have Airflow set up on your machine. You can check out this [link](http://site.clairvoyantsoft.com/installing-and-configuring-apache-airflow/) to do that.

Finally, place the the python files inside your Airflow `DAG_FOLDER` and you should be good to go. :cake:
